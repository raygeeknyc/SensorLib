/**
  Class to represent a Single pin PING Sensor that fires when its current
  value shifts more than specified thresholds:
   - A sample that is more than N percent from the average of the last S samples.
   - A set of samples where the minimum sample of more than N from the maximum one.
  The sample values are inches from the sensor.
  The class is an AnalogSensor with a different method of getting its current value.
  The PIN is a digital IO pin, not an analog one.
  The shift can be an absolute value shift or in the specified direction.
